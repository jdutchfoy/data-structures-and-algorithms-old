# Challenge Type:  Code Challenge / Algorithm

# stack-queue-pseudo
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The task is to write a Python code that creates a class that acts like a queue but uses two stacks. The class should have methods to add and remove elements from the queue, and handle errors if the queue is empty.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
 The solution should have a time complexity of O(1) for adding elements and O(n) for removing elements in the worst case.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
